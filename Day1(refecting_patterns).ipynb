      " Here is my critique and recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Impression:** Your implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm looks correct and well-structured. However, there are a few minor suggestions I have to improve code readability and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consistent Indentation:** You're using both 4-space and 8-space indentation in the code. It's better to stick to a consistent 4-space indentation throughout the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Function Documentation:** It's a good practice to include docstrings for functions to explain their purpose, parameters, and return values. This makes the code more understandable for others (and yourself in the future).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Variable Naming:** Variable names like `left` and `right` could be more descriptive. Consider renaming them to `left_half` and `right_half` for better clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Error Handling:** The `merge_sort` function assumes that the input array only contains comparable elements. You might want to add a simple check at the beginning of the function to ensure this is the case. If not, you could raise a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Code Duplication:** The lines `merged += left[left_index:]` and `merged += right[right_index:]` are identical. You could extract this into a separate function to avoid code duplication.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Return Statement:** In the `merge_sort` function, the `return` statement is not necessary at the end of the function. You can simply write `merge(merge_sort(left_half), merge_sort(right_half))` without the `return` keyword.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the modified code with these suggestions applied:\n",
